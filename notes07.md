## Lecture

Todays lecture covers more javascript and the ins and outs of functions, expressions, opreators, and refactoring code

### Expressions and operators
An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators and expressions that evaluate to a single value. This may be a number, a string, or a logical value.
 ```
 x = 7
 ```
 This is an example of an expression that declares and assigns the value 7 to the variable x
 
 ```
 x + 7
 ```
 
 this is an arithmetic expression that evaluates to 7, it does not perform an assignment. The operators used in such expressions are reffered to as **operators**
